    Hello there! 
    This is my very first post and what made me write this title is the essence of running in the race too fast without knowing the fundamentals or concepts. 
    Keep things simple and see the miracle.
    
    My name is Keyur Joshi, having keen interest in product and business analytics and enhancements. 
    There are plenty of incidents where I found people too much involved into critical thinking while doing the analysis using any of those trending tools. 
    And this brought me here to write up and keep things simple for those who are finding it difficult in analysis. 
    Especially, the new bees, freshers, entrants, enthusiasts or the ones who are having interest in “How to read and understand the data?” this could be a thoughtful post for easier productivity and standing out uncommon.
